# Multitask Learning and Data-driven Control
Preciado Lab repository for modeling of Covid-19.

This repository contains Python code to train our multitask learning model for predicting the impact of mobility restrictions on the spread of COVID-19. It also includes Matlab code for data-driven control via geometric programming using these prediction models. For full details, please see the paper linked below.

Whenever using any part of this code, please cite the following paper:
